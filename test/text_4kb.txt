abstract
Steganography is the art of concealing information in a cover media in such a way that the
presence of the information is unknown. Digital image steganography accomplishes the
potential for protected communication that is crucial in most of the applications nowadays.
Steganography has several beneficial applications. It has been driven to the frontrunner of
present security systems by the amazing development in computational power, the rise in
security consciousness. The main challenge in proposing a steganographic technique is to
maintain a suitable balance among higher embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and secu
rity that separate it from correlated systems like cryptography and watermarking. This
article offers an extensive state-of-the-art review and analysis of some recent stegano
graphic techniques. Furthermore, we have discussed popular steganography tools in detail.
Challenges in the recent deep learning based steganographic techniques have been
addressed. To explore the domain, the article concludes with mentioning some future
research directions.

1. Introduction
The internet revolution offers ease in digital communication; at the same time, it is also a challenge for us to secure the
message over the open network. For addressing the security of information, several approaches are presented as shown in
Fig. 1. The security system plays a vital role to restrict the messages from being seized by an unauthorized person. Cryptog
raphy [1] protects the content of the information that allows only the sender and intended beneficiary of communication to
view its contents. Information hiding techniques include steganography [2,3] and watermarking [4]. Both watermarking and
steganography are used to obscure the confidential information within the innocent media like image, video, audio, and text,
but both have different purposes. Watermarking is used for authentication and copyright protection of digital data. In con
trast, steganography [5] is the art of concealing information. Imperceptibility is of major importance for steganographic tech
nique, whereas watermarking provides the maximum importance to robustness. On the basis of the capability of recovering
the cover images, data hiding techniques are categorized into two groups: irreversible [6] and reversible data hiding (RDH)
