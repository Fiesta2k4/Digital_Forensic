abstract
Steganography is the art of concealing information in a cover media in such a way that the
presence of the information is unknown. Digital image steganography accomplishes the
potential for protected communication that is crucial in most of the applications nowadays.
Steganography has several beneficial applications. It has been driven to the frontrunner of
present security systems by the amazing development in computational power, the rise in
security consciousness. The main challenge in proposing a steganographic technique is to
maintain a suitable balance among higher embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and secu
rity that separate it from correlated systems like cryptography and watermarking. This
article offers an extensive state-of-the-art review and analysis of some recent stegano
graphic techniques. Furthermore, we have discussed popular steganography tools in detail.
Challenges in the recent deep learning based steganographic techniques have been
addressed. To explore the domain, the article concludes with mentioning some future
research directions.
